# celebipython
An artificial intelligence project in python in development.

This code is being written by https://github.com/davidvancleef by himself, with the purpose of being a virtual assistant for him to make things without having to ALT Tab, like playing some song on Spotify without having to search for it, opening a game or Discord and maybe even turning the house lights on and off. Since he's a begginner in python and doesn't code a lot, this probably will take time to be completed. For the purpose of not having to ALT Tab to be completed, this assistant probably will have to understand commands via pyaudio, which will take a lot of time to implement.
