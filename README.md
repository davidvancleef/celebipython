# celebipython
An artificial intelligence project in python in development.

This code is being written by https://github.com/davidvancleef by himself, with the purpose of being a virtual assistant for him to make things without having to ALT Tab, like playing some song on Spotify without having to search for it, opening a game or Discord and maybe even turning the house lights on and off. Since he's a beginner in Python and doesn't code a lot, this probably will take time to be completed.
